## Overview

This project aims to classify brain hemispheres and detect tumors within MRI images using a combination of SWIN Transformer, a state-of-the-art architecture for image processing, and YOLOv8, a robust object detection algorithm.

## Features

- **Brain Hemisphere Classification:** Utilizes SWIN Transformer to classify brain hemispheres from MRI scans.
- **Tumor Detection:** Employs YOLOv8 for precise tumor detection within each classified hemisphere.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Includes data preprocessing steps for image augmentation, normalization, and preparation.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Provides evaluation metrics for both hemisphere classification and tumor detection accuracy.

'''The app is yet to be deployed to see how it works'''
